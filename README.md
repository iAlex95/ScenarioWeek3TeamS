# Scenario Week 3 | Desktop Application
## Team S - Jamie Law, Jasmine Lu, Alex Xu, Yee Chong Tan

The goal of the week is to get as far as you can with designing and developing a desktop
application that can be run on one of the most widely used operating systems: Windows, OS
X or Linux. 

The software will be used by people who are learning electronics and thus should
contain a simple schematic editor and electronic circuit simulator. 

Essentially, the application will be a virtual breadboard enabling the user to draw and test basic circuits
composed of electrical components and, possibly, a microcontroller.
